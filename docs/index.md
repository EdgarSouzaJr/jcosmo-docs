# JCOSMO Documentation

Welcome to **JCOSMO documentation!** JCOSMO is a computational tool developed by [LVPP-UFRGS](https://ufrgs.br/lvpp/) for modern quasi-chemical models (*e.g.* COSMO-SAC).

Modern quasi-chemical models are invaluable tools for a wide range of applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery, enabling researchers to make informed decisions and explore novel chemical spaces.

Example of applications:

- Solubilities
- Partition coefficients (e.g. octanol/water)
- Vapor-liquid equilibria
- Liquid-liquid equilibria
- Solid-liquid equilibria
- Screening
- Solvent selection
- Pharmaceuticals
- Extraction processes
- Ionic Liquids
- Deep eutectic solvents
- Electrolyte systems
- Biochemical separations
- Polymer-solvent interactions and equilibria
- Gas absorption
- Lubricant formulation
- etc.

This documentation guides users through installation, usage, theoretical foundations, and advanced features of JCOSMO.
